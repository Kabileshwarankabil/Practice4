1. Print numbers From 1 to 5
2. Display a text ("Hello World!") 5 times
3. Print even numbers between 0 and 10
4. To find the number and sum of all integers between 100 and 200 which are divisible by 9.
	Numbers between 100 and 200, divisible by 9:
	108 117 126 135 144 153 162 171 180 189 198
	The sum : 1683
5. Given a positive integer N, calculate the factorial (N!), which is the product of all integers from 1 to N. 
	For example, 
    if N is 5, 
    then N! (factorial) is 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120
6. Given a positive integer N, calculate the sum of all even numbers from 1 to N. 
	For instance, 
    if N is 10, the sum would be 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 30
7. Given an integer num, count the number of digits in num. For example, if num is 12345, the output should be 5
8.  Given a positive integer N, display the multiplication table of N up to 10. For
	 example, if N is 5, the output should be:
	 5 * 1 =5
	 5 * 2 =10
	 5 * 3 =15
	 ...
	 5 * 10 = 50
9. Given an integer num, reverse the digits. For example, if num is 12345, the
	output should be 54321.
10.  To display the pattern like a right angle triangle with a number.
	 Sample Output:
	 Input number of rows: 5
	 1
	 1 2
	 1 2 3
	 1 2 3 4
	 1 2 3 4 5
